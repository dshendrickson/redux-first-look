## First Look at Redux
_____

We are starting with a copy of the mini React app from the React-In-Theory lesson.

For this starter kit I worked off of the [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) command to generate a scaffold with all the necessary React dependencies and scripts.

For details on what the scripts are doing behind the scenes, check out the [react-scripts documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts).  

### Project Setup
Install the dependencies  
`npm install`  

Because we are using the create-react-app setup we can kick things off directly with:  
`npm start`

It should boot up automatically, but if not visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in a browser.

The page is setup with hot-reload so it will reload automatically if you make changes.
